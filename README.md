# Ecosystem Climate Regulation Services

## Introduction

This repository contains the data and codes for replication of the results presented in the manuscript entitled 'Conserving the Cerrado and Amazon biomes of Brazil protects the soy economy from damaging warming', submitted to the journal World Development.

The codes presented here process data on native vegetation, past climate, future climate projections, agriculture, and future projections of land use and land cover. This data is used to estimate the role of native vegetation in Brazil in providing regulation of extreme heat for neighboring soybean production.
